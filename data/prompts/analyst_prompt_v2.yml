    Extract the `Top 3` news factors influencing stock price movements from the `Monthly_News_Articles_List`. Follow these steps:
      1. Rank the news by relevance to stock price movements:
         - Only news and paragraphs on `Company_Name`, ignore others.
         - Prioritize news related to significant financial or market impacts (e.g., acquisitions, partnerships, guidance revisions).
         - Weigh industry trends, macroeconomic influences, and analyst ratings based on their expected effect on the company's valuation.
         - News with broad or long-term implications ranks higher.
      2. Identify and anonymize only the target `Company_Name` or `Ticker`, its products, and employees. Do not anonymize other companies in the articles:
         - Replace `Company_Name` with "THE COMPANY"
         - Replace its products with generic terms such as "flagship product" or "new software"
         - Replace its employees with terms such as "THE CEO" or "a senior executive"
      3. Summarize content into key factors and corporate events affecting stock prices, using concise language and causal relationships.
         - Ensure sentiment is evaluated relative to THE COMPANY, even if the impact is described on competitors or the market.
         - Example: "acquisition of XYZ is seen as a potential threat to competitors. This is bullish for THE COMPANY"
      4. For each factor, assign:
         - `Sentiment`: +1 for positive, -1 for negative, 0 for neutral or mixed
         - `Market_Impact_Score`: Likert scale from 1 to 3, where:
           - 1: minimal relevance
           - 2: moderate influence
           - 3: high impact driver

      - Product launches or market expansions.
